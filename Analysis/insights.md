## From the Heat-Map that was generated the insgihts that was found useful are :

**12-18 Months**:
- Predominantly light yellow cells (scores around -4 to -15) suggest lower QCHAT-10 scores, indicating fewer or less pronounced ASD traits. This aligns with the idea that autism symptoms may be subtler or harder to detect in younger toddlers.

**18-24 Months**:
- A transition zone with more orange hues (-15 to -25), reflecting an increase in higher QCHAT-10 scores. This age range is a critical window for autism screening, as many diagnostic signs (e.g., social communication delays) become more apparent.

**24-36 Months**:
- Darker red cells (-30 to -45) dominate, indicating a higher prevalence of elevated QCHAT-10 scores. This could suggest that ASD traits are more detectable or severe in this age group, consistent with developmental progression and increased screening sensitivity.

## ASD traits in toddlers vs Family History of ASD

**From The Graph**:
-- It is observed that the toddlers with ASD and Family History of ASD doesn't have that common siginficance on each other. Both the traits may be consider independent of esch other.

-- The toddlers with ASD. Their family History of ASD has less significant .
